# tableau
This repository is a place to store all the code used to scrape and clean data used to build Tableau dashboards. Each project has a .py file and folder with the datasets.  

# final product
All dashboards can be found on my [Tableau Public profile](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/huimarco).
